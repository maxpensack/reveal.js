                        #### Geometry, representations, ACC, oh my!

                        But...

                        <p class="fragment">"Our analyses were focused on single-neuron activity, demonstrating that we can track dynamics of representations even at the single-cell level."</p>

                        ## Background: Task
                        - rule-based, multi-cue stimuli classification

                        --

                        Authors told similar story in humans, with special focus on differences in learning across individuals (Cohen and Schneidman, 2013)

                        ---

                        ## Background: Brain Areas
                        - Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC):
                            - Learning, attention, executive control, conflict monitoring
                        - Striatum:
                            - BG > Striatum (dorsal) > Caudate & Putamen
                            - Motor control, RL, and (recently) executive fuctions
                            - Learning related changes may precede those in DLPFC (Pasupathy and Miller, 2005)

                        <img src="f1.jpg" class="r-stretch">

                        ---

                        ## Learning curves
                        <img src="f2a.jpg" class="r-stretch">

                        <img src="f2b-d.jpg" class="r-stretch">

                        ---

                        ## Rule "Performance"
                        <img src="f2e.jpg" class="r-stretch">

                        --

                        ## Naive "Learn One" Model
                        `$$ \left(\frac{1}{8} \times 1.0\right) + \left(\frac{7}{8} \times 0.5\right) = 56.25\% $$`

                        --

                        "The notion that the monkeys learned the rules rather than the label of individual patterns was supported by several lines of evidence."

                        --

                        "First, in pure stimulus-response associative learning, the correct response to each stimulus would be acquired independent of other stimuli, and the performance on particular patterns would be the same under different rules."

                        --

                        "In contrast, we found that pattern-specific error rates show dependence on the specific rule and were correlated with performance on other patterns."

                        --

                        "Second, classification of the visually salient patterns showed variability across rules and dependence on the specific rule."

                        <img src="s1e.png" class="r-stretch">

                        --

                        "Third, rule learning was supported by the consistency across learning of different rules."

                        --

                        "Fourth, monkeys could even learn 4-bit rules for which memorization is extremely unlikely (there are 65,536 different deterministic rules for the 16 stimulus patterns)."

                        <img src="f2f.jpg" class="r-stretch">

                        --

                        "Fifth, performance for specific patterns deteriorated following a change of the rule, even when the new rule did not require learning new associations for these patterns."

                        <img src="s1i-n.png" class="r-stretch">

                        --

                        "Finally, a simple strategy based on performance (win-stay, lose-switch) poorly described answer sequences."

                        <img src="s1o.png" class="r-stretch">

                        --

                        "The evidence suggests that monkeys did not use simple memorization of stimulus-response associations as the main strategy and therefore supports the notion of rule learning."

                        ## Summary
                        - A geometrical framework reveals single-neuron dynamics during de novo rule learning
                        - Neurons in the dACC reflect search for the new rule-based behavioral policy
                        - Neurons in the putamen also reflect confidence increase that follows the policy search
                        - The neural representation predicts overnight retention and generalization of rules
